Interface to open NEMO ocean global circulation model output as an [Xarray](https://docs.xarray.dev/en/stable/) Dataset and create a [xgcm](https://xgcm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) grid. 
NEMO 3.6, 4.0, and 4.2.0 are tested and supported. Any version between 3.6 and 4.2.0 should work,
but in case of trouble, [please open an issue](https://github.com/rcaneill/xnemogcm/issues).
