# xnemogcm

Interface to open NEMO global circulation model output dataset and create a xgcm grid.

One can be interested by the [XORCA](https://github.com/willirath/xorca)
python package, that does a similar work for
all NEMO output grid. xnemogcm is designed to be more simple
and adapted to a simple idealized configuration.
